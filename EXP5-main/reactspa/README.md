# Experiment 5: React Single Page Application (SPA)

## Overview
This experiment focuses on building a modern **Single Page Application (SPA)** using React and Vite. The project demonstrates the core concepts of component-based architecture, state management, and client-side routing in contemporary web development.

## What We Did
We created a React-based web application with the following components:
- **App Component** - Main application entry point that handles routing and layout
- **Dashboard Component** - Displays key information and metrics in an interactive interface
- Custom styling with CSS for a responsive UI

## How We Did It

### Technology Stack
- **React** - JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces with components
- **Vite** - Modern build tool providing fast development server and optimized production builds
- **ESLint** - Code quality and best practices enforcement
- **CSS** - Styling for responsive and visually appealing design

### Development Process
1. **Project Setup** - Initialized a React project with Vite for fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
2. **Component Structure** - Created modular, reusable React components (App, Dashboard)
3. **Styling** - Applied CSS for layout and visual design
4. **Development** - Used Vite's development server for rapid testing and iteration

### Key Features
- Fast refresh during development with HMR enabled
- ESLint configuration for code consistency
- Component-based architecture for maintainability
- Client-side rendering for dynamic user experience
